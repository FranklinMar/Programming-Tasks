Description: If the variables 'a' and 'b' inside the "myclass" 
  class Task 04 weren't declared "private" (by default) but 
  "protected" members, would any of your answers to the question 
  of previous exercise change? If yes, why?
------------------------------------------------------------
*/
/* Answer - NO, because the problem lies not in the access 
  to 'a' and 'b' variables, but inside initalization.*/
